    <h3>

    <h3>
        2. Analysis Plan

    </h3>
    <p>
        Utlizing a dataset of 30min interviews with undergrads, we take all variables from the conversativons and identify the most important features for chooses Redbull over other energy drinks.
        We are also working with a dataset of online reviews from sources such as Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter to identify a common pattern of choice between these customers.
        <br><br>  
        Here are the steps for excecuting this plan:
        <ul>
            
            <li><b>Consolidate all customer data</b> in one data model by chooses important / common features </li> 
            <br>
            
            <li>Run analysis to <b>find correlation </b>between variables and eliminate un-important variables</li>
            <br>
            <li>Rank variables from most important and identify <b>customer segment</b> that responds most closely to it</li>
        
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            It is clear from this chart that the <b>most common response</b> from our data falls within the <b>Utility</b> category. There might have been bias within our data since most of the demographic is college students;
            however, college students are still a huge part of the energy drinks segment as almost all campuses nationwide have Redbull sponsored events held annually.
                    
    </p>


    <p>
       People who prefer Redbull generally enjoy how effective it is and also prefer the taste over other energy drinks. Effectiveness and Caffeine content play hand-to-hand and thus the high
       score on both for Redbull solidifies our intial findings of work/study category use.
        
                
    </p>

    <p>
        After narrowing down the segments within Redbull's customer demographic, we identified the heavy drinkers don't have a 
        preference to taste as compared to light drinkers.
                   
     </p>
     <h3>

        Conclusion and Recommendations
     </h3>

     <li><b></b> Red Bull is preferred due to its <b>High Effectiveness</b> and <b>Caffeine Content</b> but not its taste</li> 
     <br>
     
     <li>Mangement should <b>focus</b> on developing marketing campaigns <b>highlighting RedBull's strong effectiveness</b> and illustrate scenarios of work / study consumptions and less 
        towards social activites (nightclubs / partying). Even though that remains a market for RedBull, the <b>customer acquistion cost</b> for that segment is higher compared to Utility work.
        </li>
     <br>
     <li>Finally <b>customer segment</b> that responds most closely to it</li>
